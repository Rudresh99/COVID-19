In the wake of the current global health crisis, it becomes vital for us to have accurate data, in order to make informed decisions and take precautionary measures. I have collected data from reliable sources and created these dashboards using Power BI and Python. I also urge you to follow recommendations from the WHO and your respective governments, in order to prevent the further spread of this virus. Please stay safe, and we wish you and your families the best in these trying times.
